# Gert

An awesome WordPress plugin for uploading large files. 

Gert taps into the [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) making it super easy to handle any type or size of file without needing to upload it to the server first. Say goodbye to max upload sizes!

## Usage
* Install
* Activate
* Go to Gert's upload page
* Start uploading!
